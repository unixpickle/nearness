# nearness

This is the code involved in my entries to the [Reversing Nearness](http://azspcs.com/Contest/Nearness) contest. It is a simple iterative algorithm that makes random permutations and keeps the ones that improve the score of each board.

The algorithm kept improving beyond my latest submission, but I got banned from the contest for auto-submitting solutions periodically. Consequently, I stopped working on the contest and decided to open source my code.
